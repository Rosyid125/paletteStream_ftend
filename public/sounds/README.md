# Notification Sound File
# 
# This directory should contain:
# - notification.mp3: The main notification sound file
# 
# For now, you can:
# 1. Add your own notification.mp3 file here
# 2. Or use the Web Audio API fallback that creates synthetic sounds
# 
# The system will automatically fallback to a synthetic beep sound
# if no audio file is found.
